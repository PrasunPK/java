The Supreme Court on Monday appealed to Jat protesters demanding government benefits to maintain peace and rapped the Delhi government for approaching it over a water crisis triggered by the violent demonstrations.
“You people (Delhi government), instead of solving the problem at government-to-government level, are moving to the Supreme Court. You want order from the Supreme Court. You want everything on the platter,” Chief Justice of India TS Thakur said.
The SC sought a status report from the Haryana government on the plea of Delhi government seeking resumption of water supply to the national capital, disrupted due to the ongoing Jat quota agitation.
The bench was initially reluctant to take up the plea of the Delhi government. “You ministers are sitting in the court instead of going to the field. You rest in AC chambers and you want order from the court,” it said, referring to the presence of Delhi water minister Kapil Mishra in the court.
However, after persistence from advocate Rajeev Dhawan, appearing for the Delhi government, the bench asked the Haryana government to make the necessary arrangements for the resumption of water supply to the capital.
